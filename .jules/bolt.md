## 2026-04-15 - Adaptive Frame Throttle in react-native-vision-camera
**Learning:** High-frequency MediaPipe landmarker execution in a continuous mobile frame processor can cause severe thermal build-up and battery drain, even when no target object (e.g., hands) is present.
**Action:** Use `react-native-worklets-core` `useSharedValue` to track consecutive empty frames natively inside the worklet, and dynamically back-off the processing interval when idle to significantly reduce sustained CPU/GPU load without missing the target's re-entry.
